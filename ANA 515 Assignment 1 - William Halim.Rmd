## R Markdown

```{r get data, include=FALSE}
url <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data/master/full_data.csv'
gun_deaths <- read_csv(url)
glimpse(gun_deaths)
```

```{r data manipulation, include=FALSE}
youth <- gun_deaths %>%
  filter(age <= 65)
summary(youth)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#This next chunk is inline code. Inline code puts the text with the output of the function in my document.
```

We have data about 'r nrow(gun_deaths)' individuals killed by guns. Only 'r nrow(gun_deaths) - nrow(youth)' are older than 65. The distribution of the remainder is shown below:

#Gun deaths by age
```{r youth-dist, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
youth %>%
  ggplot(aes(age))+geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 1)
```

#Gun deaths by race
```{r race-dist, echo=FALSE}
youth %>%
  ggplot(aes(fct_infreq(race) %>% fct_rev())) + geom_bar() + coord_flip() + labs(x = "Victim race")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Once all of my code has been written, I click on the Knit button in the tool bar above to produce my document.
```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
